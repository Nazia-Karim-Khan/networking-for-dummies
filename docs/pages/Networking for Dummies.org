N.B: I tried to simulate the network only with docker containers, so that people working on Windows and Mac can follow, but unknowingly I used the namespace features, which is only available on linux.

* The Problem
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
Meena and Raju have got new computers to play around. They played a lot of solo mission based based games. Their favorite game is Call of Duty MW3. They have finished all the campaign and now looking forward to the special ops challenges. They have successfully completed the first five special ops missions but the sixth one is *Firewall* a *co-op* mission.

Let's took at Meena and Raju's room
[[../assets/image_1695215839229_0.png]]

Now they have to find a way to connect the two computers together and finish the *coop mission*. How will they do it?
* We need a network!
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
Network is a group of interconnected computers sharing resources.
Here we need a network to share Meena and Raju's location, actions and the overall world state within the game.

For creating a network:
 - Firstly we need nodes(computers) that follows the `same language`(protocol) when sharing data between them.
 - We need to connect the computers
* Simulating Nodes
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
We will be used docker containers to simulate nodes.
#+BEGIN_SRC Dockerfile
# nfd-node.dockerfile
FROM fedora:latest

RUN dnf update -y

RUN dnf install -y tcpdump iproute iputils bind-utils net-tools iptables

ENTRYPOINT sleep infinity
#+END_SRC

To build the image,
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker build --tag nfd-node --file nfd-node.dockerfile .
#+END_SRC
* Creating the nodes
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
We will create the nodes by running two docker containers of the ~nfd-node~ image
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker run -d --rm --name nfd-node-meena --network none --privileged --hostname nfd-node-meena nfd-node:latest
docker run -d --rm --name nfd-node-raju --network none --privileged --hostname nfd-node-raju nfd-node:latest
#+END_SRC
* Accessing the nodes
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
I am using tmux for accessing all the nodes in a single screen. (I have not setup wm yet ðŸ˜”).
For getting into the nodes execute the following commands in different terminals.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker exec -it nfd-node-meena bash
docker exec -it nfd-node-raju bash
#+END_SRC
After that you will have access to nodes. And it will look something like the following
[[../assets/image_1695912258299_0.png]]
* Connecting the computers (phase-1)
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
In this phase, we are going to connect the nodes directly with ethernet cable and interfaces. Of course, we dont have any cables within the virtual space, so we have to use virtual ethernet cables and interfaces.

Each of the interface will get its own device address(mac address) and a network address(ip address) to talk to other computers on the network.
* What is a network interface?
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
It is usually a hardware component that is used to connect the computer. It is the peripheral device that acts as a junction point. Network interfaces are generally physical devices, but doesn't have to be; it can also be a software simulating the network device. And that's what we will be using today to simulate our network.
The first device we will use to simulate the connection between two nodes are virtual ethernet devices (veth)
* Network Interfaces:
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
** LOOPBACK
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 3
:END:
By default all nodes have loopback interfaces installed on them by default. If we execute the ~ip addr~ command on meena and raju's computer we will see, that they have only loopback interfaces.

[[../assets/image_1695915428748_0.png]] 

The loopback interface, which is a virtual interface used for internal communication within the same device. It has IPV4 address of ~127.0.0.1~ which is local only to host (localhost), and its MAC address is typically set to all zeros.
** VETH
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 3
:END:
Veth acts as tunnel through which devices on one network can talk to devices on another network. Veth devices are always created in interconnected pairs. Packets transmitted on one device in the pair are immediately received on the other device. A pair can be created using the command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ip link add <p1-name> type veth peer name <p2-name>
#+END_SRC
In the above, p1-name and p2-name are the names assigned to the two connected end points.
* Connecting the computers...continued
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
And now we will try to create a pair of veth devices that connects meena and raju's computers together.
[[../assets/image_1695913755287_0.png]]

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo ip link add veth-meena type veth peer name veth-raju
ip addr | grep veth -A1
#+END_SRC

After running this command we will have a pair of virtual ethernet devices in our own machine. Now the state looks something like this.
[[../assets/image_1695914059672_0.png]]

Notice that the newly created veth interfaces have unique MAC addresses associated associated with them. MAC addresses are unique identifiers assigned to network devices. They still don't have any IP address associated with them.

Now let's associate the interfaces to the nodes.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo ip link set netns $(docker container inspect --format '{{.State.Pid}}' nfd-node-meena) dev veth-meena
sudo ip link set netns $(docker container inspect --format '{{.State.Pid}}' nfd-node-raju) dev veth-raju
#+END_SRC

I promise I will explain what these complex commands do when its time. For now just hang with me.

Roughly speaking we set the veth-meena interface to nfd-node-meena and vice versa. Now lets see the interfaces in the nodes.
[[../assets/image_1695917713076_0.png]]

Notice that meena's computer have now interface named veth-meena and the same for raju.

Upto now, the interfaces only have device addresses. Which means they are layer 2 interfaces.
* Network Layers
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
Let's look into the layers that makes up the network.
[[https://media.fs.com/images/community/upload/kindEditor/202107/29/original-seven-layers-of-osi-model-1627523878-JYjV8oybcC.png]]

The first layer is the physical layer and we don't see it in our network, because, well its virtual network, we don't need physical wires to connect them. When we created the veth pairs the physical and data link layers are taken as granted by default and we didn't have to worry about them. What we do need to worry about is layer 3, the network layer.
In this layer we need logical addresses for the devices, for if we want them to communicate. These addresses are called IP addresses.
And now we will assign IP addresses to our virtual network interfaces. Before assigning IP addresses, lets talk a little bit more about IP addresses.
* Network (IP) Address
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
Every IP address has two parts, the first part is same and the second part is unique for all the devices in the network. Let's look at how we can identify these two parts.
The first part is also called the network address. As obvious it is, the network address for all the devices in the same network is same.

Let's take a look at an IP address example ~192.168.0.5/24~
Here the ip address is comprised of 4 segments of 8 bits.
~00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000~
So the lowest value is ~0.0.0.0~ and the highest value is ~255.255.255.255~
And the /X part identifies the network address also known as network mask. Here 24 means first 24 bits will be taken as network address and the remaining bits will be allocated to the devices.
So in this network, ~192.168.0~ is the network part, and the last 8 bits are allocated to devices. So that means the network has addresses from ~192.168.0.0~ to ~192.168.0.255~. This means this network can have 256 devices connected to each other.
But there is a catch, there are two special reserved addresses for a network, the first and the last one. The first one is called network address and the last one is called broadcast address.
So, here the addresses ~192.168.0.0~ is the network address and ~192.168.0.255~ is the broadcast address. Broadcast address is a little bit special in the sense that, any message sent to the broadcast address will be delivered to all of the devices in the network. And thus, we have 254 unique addresses in the network ~192.168.0.0/24~.

Now let's do a little exercise, if the network address is ~192.168.0.0/18~, what will be the broadcast address of the network? How many devices can this network contain?
Let's convert the address in bits.
~11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000~
Here the first 18 bits are untouchable, since it's the network address, and its same for everybody. The two separated parts are:
~11000000.10101000.00~ ~000000.00000000~
So here the network mask is:
~11111111.11111111.11~ ~000000.00000000~ or ~255.255.192.0~
And the highest address will be:
~11000000.10101000.00~ ~111111.11111111~
So the network address is ~192.168.0.0/18~ and the broadcast address is ~192.168.63.255/18~
And the network can contain ~2^14 = 16384 - 2 = 16382~ devices.

Following this procedure, we can break a large network into smaller networks, which is called subnetting.
* Connecting the computers...continued...
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
Let's create a new network with address 10.2.3.0/24.
Note that this network doesn't overlap with any other networks in my machine.
[[../assets/Screenshot_from_2023-09-28_22-44-18_1696043036103_0.png]]

Now we will assign IP address 10.2.3.2 to meena and 10.2.3.3 to raju.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ip addr add 10.2.3.2/24 dev veth-meena
ip addr add 10.2.3.3/24 dev veth-raju
#+END_SRC
After that it will look something like this.
[[../assets/image_1695918847119_0.png]]

Note that the state is still down.
[[../assets/Screenshot_from_2023-09-30_09-09-07-mh_1696043574852_0.png]]

We need to turn them UP.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo ip link set dev veth-meena up
sudo ip link set dev veth-raju up
#+END_SRC
And then we can communicate with the computers in the network.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ping -c 2 10.2.3.3
ping -c 2 10.2.3.2
#+END_SRC
[[../assets/image_1696043882398_0.png]]

And with that we are done with phase 1. We have successfully connected two computers with a virtual ethernet pair and established network within themselves.
Now meena and raju can complete the ~coop~ missions in Call of Duty.
* Network Protocols
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
We haven't talked about the ping command and what it does, lets learn a little bit about the language of the communication, i.e. the protocols of the network.
** ICMP
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 3
:END:
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a network layer protocol used by network devices to diagnose network communication issues. ICMP is mainly used to determine whether or not data is reaching its intended destination in a timely manner.

Here we used the ping command to send an ICMP message to the other computer in the network and if everythingis OK, then they reply with a response and the communication between the two computers is established successfully.
We will talk about other network protocols as we progress on.
* Connecting the computers (phase-2)
:PROPERTIES:
:heading: 2
:END:
It's going all well, but recently meetu has been gifted a new laptop on his birthday and now, he also wants to play along with them.
[[../assets/image_1696061356581_0.png]]
How do we connect all of their computers in the same network?

One solution would be connecting all of the computers with each other. Although it is a solution, it's a bad one.
The solution doesn't scale if we need to add more computers. Lot's of connections makes it harder to maintain and debug.
The better solution is to bring in a *Router*

If we want to mentally visualize, the network will look something like below:
[[../assets/image_1696097354631_0.png]] 

Here the number of connections scale linearly as the no of devices grow.

Now we will create an additional node to emulate meetu's computer.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker run -d --rm --name nfd-node-meetu --network none --privileged --hostname nfd-node-meetu nfd-node:latest
docker exec -it nfd-node-meetu bash
#+END_SRC

Then we will delete the old veth interface pair on meena and raju's computer.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ip link delete veth-meena
#+END_SRC

If we delete one of the interface, the other one will be automatically deleted.
[[../assets/image_1696185719575_0.png]]

Now we will create a virtual interface of type *bridge* that will actually act as a router for our network.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo ip link add nfd-rtr type bridge
ip addr | grep nfd-rtr -A1
#+END_SRC
[[../assets/image_1696186776785_0.png]]

Now we will create the veth pairs for the connections.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo ip link add veth-meena-rtr type veth peer name veth-rtr-meena
sudo ip link add veth-raju-rtr type veth peer name veth-rtr-raju
sudo ip link add veth-meetu-rtr type veth peer name veth-rtr-meetu
ip addr | grep veth -A1
#+END_SRC

[[../assets/image_1696187040059_0.png]]

Now we will associate the interfaces to the machines like before.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo ip link set netns $(docker container inspect --format '{{.State.Pid}}' nfd-node-meena) dev veth-meena-rtr
sudo ip link set netns $(docker container inspect --format '{{.State.Pid}}' nfd-node-raju) dev veth-raju-rtr
sudo ip link set netns $(docker container inspect --format '{{.State.Pid}}' nfd-node-meetu) dev veth-meetu-rtr
#+END_SRC

And assign ip addresses to the interfaces.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo ip addr add 10.2.3.2/24 dev veth-meena-rtr
sudo ip addr add 10.2.3.3/24 dev veth-raju-rtr
sudo ip addr add 10.2.3.4/24 dev veth-meetu-rtr
#+END_SRC

And now, if we see the interfaces, it will look something like below.
[[../assets/image_1696188956498_0.png]]

After that we need to connect the other end of the veth pair with the router.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo ip link set veth-rtr-meena master nfd-rtr
sudo ip link set veth-rtr-raju master nfd-rtr
sudo ip link set veth-rtr-meetu master nfd-rtr
brctl show nfd-rtr
#+END_SRC

[[../assets/image_1696190483136_0.png]]

Now it's time to bring up all the connections.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo ip link set nfd-rtr up
sudo ip link set veth-rtr-meena up
sudo ip link set veth-rtr-raju up
sudo ip link set veth-rtr-meetu up

ip link set veth-meena-rtr up
ip link set veth-raju-rtr up
ip link set veth-meetu-rtr up
#+END_SRC

[[../assets/image_1696190922391_0.png]]

Now if we ping the other devices in the network,
[[../assets/image_1696226945994_0.png]]

We can see, from the host machine(upper left hand corner), we can ping all four of the devices.
But on the other machines, we can only ping the router and the machine itself.
Now there are two questions:
- How is the host machine communicating with all the devices in different network?
- The other machines can't communicate with each other. But the router is supposed to forward the packets to the destined ip addresses, why isn't it doing so?

In this phase, we will learn about debugging network communications. Stay hydrated, it's gonna be a walk through the Sahara.

Firstly we will run a tcpdump command on meena's machine and get all the information we want.


The following `tcpdump` command captures network traffic on the specified network interface (`veth-meena-rtr`) and filters it to display packets involving the host with the IP address 10.2.3.3. Here's a breakdown of the command and what it does:

- `tcpdump`: This is the command used for packet capture and analysis.

- `-n`: The `-n` option prevents `tcpdump` from performing hostname resolution, so it displays IP addresses and port numbers instead of resolving them to hostnames and service names.

- `-vvv`: The `-vvv` option increases the verbosity level, providing more detailed information about each captured packet. In this case, it's set to a high verbosity level, which means you'll get extensive packet details.

- `-e`: The `-e` option instructs `tcpdump` to display the link-level header (Ethernet frame header) information, including source and destination MAC addresses.

- `-i veth-meena-rtr`: The `-i` option specifies the network interface (`veth-meena-rtr`) on which `tcpdump` should capture packets.

- `host 10.2.3.3`: This filter specifies that you want to capture packets where the source or destination IP address is 10.2.3.3. This filter helps you focus on traffic involving this specific IP address.

When you run this command, `tcpdump` will capture network packets on the `veth-meena-rtr` interface and display detailed information for each packet that matches the specified filter (packets involving the IP address 10.2.3.3). The output will include source and destination IP addresses, source and destination MAC addresses, and other packet details. This is useful for monitoring or troubleshooting network traffic to or from the specified host.
